To impress his fictional manager at **TheOpsFactory**, he scripted a **.bat file** and used **Task Scheduler** to run it every 5 minutes. “Now even when I sleep, my files sync!” he chuckled. Automation level: 100!

### 🧹 Delete and Celebrate

After everything worked smoothly, our Azure admin cleaned up like a responsible cloud citizen. He deleted the resources using the Azure portal, smiled with satisfaction, and gave himself a virtual high five. Another lab conquered, and another skill unlocked.
