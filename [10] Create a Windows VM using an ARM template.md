**After logging in with your credentials:**

### Step 1: Explore the ARM Template

1. Download the `template.json` file from the provided lab resources and extract it to your local machine.
2. Review the structure of the ARM template. It includes:

   * **Parameters** such as `adminUsername`, `adminPassword`, `dnsLabelPrefix`, and VM configuration options.
   * **Variables** for commonly reused values (e.g., subnet name, virtual network name).
   * **Resources** including a storage account, public IP, network security group (NSG), virtual network (VNet), network interface (NIC), and a virtual machine.
   * **Outputs** to return the public DNS hostname of the deployed VM.

### Step 2: Upload the Template to Cloud Shell

1. Open **Cloud Shell** from the top-right menu in the Azure Portal.
2. Select **Bash** when prompted.
3. If asked to configure storage, select **No storage account required**, and choose the appropriate subscription.
4. Use the **Upload** option in Cloud Shell to upload your `template.json` file into the shell environment.

### Step 3: Deploy the ARM Template

1. Use the following command in Cloud Shell to deploy the template:

   ```bash
   az deployment group create \
     --name <deployment-name> \
     --template-file template.json \
     --parameters '{
       "adminUsername": {"value": "<admin-username>"},
       "adminPassword": {"value": "<admin-password>"}
     }' \
     --resource-group <resource-group-name>
   ```

## **üìò Real-World Scenario: "Naveed Automates Like a Pro"**

At **LearnTechCloud**, business was booming, and the IT team needed to spin up **Windows virtual machines** frequently to support development and testing projects. But the process of clicking through the portal every time was slow and error-prone. That‚Äôs when **Naveed**, the **Curious Cloud Explorer**, stepped in with a bold plan: automate the entire deployment using an **ARM template**.

---

### **üìÅ Step 1: Understanding the Blueprint**

First, our Azure admin opened the **template.json** file. This wasn't just a simple config‚Äîit was a **blueprint**. It included **parameters** like `"adminUsername"` and `"adminPassword"`, **variables** for network names, and a **set of resources** like **virtual networks**, **NSGs**, **NICs**, and even **storage accounts**. Naveed realized that by editing this single file, he could control the entire infrastructure like a conductor leads an orchestra.

üìå *Example*: The **VM size**, region, and even network security rules were defined without clicking a single button.

---

### **üåê Step 2: Uploading to Azure Cloud Shell**

To get started, Naveed fired up **Azure Cloud Shell**‚Äîa command-line interface right in the portal. He uploaded the ARM template using the ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù option and verified that it landed in the shell environment. This step brought the deployment code into Azure‚Äôs environment, making it ready to launch.

---

### **üöÄ Step 3: Deploy with a Single Command**

In true DevOps fashion, he ran a single **Azure CLI** command:

```bash
az deployment group create --name deployVM01 --template-file template.json --parameters ...
```

The magic began. Azure read the **template**, accepted the **parameter values**, and within minutes, a fully configured **Windows VM**, complete with networking, security, diagnostics, and storage, was born inside **rg-learntech-naveed**.

---

### **üìä Step 4: Verifying Everything Works**

## **Professional Scenario: Automating VM Deployment with ARM Templates**

**Background:**

Meet **Emma**, a Cloud Engineer working at **Contoso Financial Services**, a mid-sized company moving its infrastructure to the cloud. Her team is responsible for managing development and test environments in **Microsoft Azure**. The developers frequently request Windows-based **Virtual Machines (VMs)** with similar configurations. Emma needs a way to standardize and automate these requests without manually clicking through the **Azure portal** every time.

**The Challenge:**

Manual VM creation is time-consuming and error-prone. Each VM requires setting up networking, assigning a **Public IP address**, configuring **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**, and enabling **boot diagnostics**. Emma needs a repeatable, auditable, and scalable way to deploy infrastructure consistently. That's where **ARM templates** come into play.

---

## **Scenario Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Understanding the ARM Template**

Emma starts by reviewing an **ARM template** named `template.json`, which is a **JSON** file defining all the infrastructure components needed to deploy a Windows **Virtual Machine**. This includes:

* **Virtual Network (VNet)** and **Subnet** for network isolation
* **Network Interface (NIC)** for network connectivity
* A **Network Security Group (NSG)** to allow **RDP** access
* A **Storage Account** for diagnostics
* A **Public IP address** for remote access
* The **VM** itself with custom parameters like OS version, size, and admin credentials

By using this template, Emma ensures that every VM deployment is uniform and compliant with organizational standards.

---

### **Step 2: Deploying the Template via Azure Cloud Shell**

Emma logs into the **Azure portal** and launches **Azure Cloud Shell (Bash)**, which provides a browser-based CLI environment without any local setup. She uploads the `template.json` file using the **Manage file** option.

Using the **Azure CLI** inside Cloud Shell, Emma runs the deployment command:

```bash
az deployment group create \
  --name dev-vm-deployment \
  --template-file template.json \
  --parameters '{
    "adminUsername": {"value": "emmaadmin"},
    "adminPassword": {"value": "StrongPassword123!"}
  }' \
  --resource-group DevResources
```

This command triggers the **ARM template** deployment, which orchestrates the creation of all resources in the specified **Resource Group**.

---

### **Step 3: Verifying the Deployment**

Once the deployment finishes, Emma navigates to the **Resource Group** in the **Azure portal**. She sees:

* A fully provisioned **Windows VM**
* A connected **NIC** attached to a **VNet**
* An assigned **Public IP**
* An associated **NSG** with **RDP** port open
* A configured **Storage Account** for diagnostics

The best part? All of this was done with a single command using infrastructure defined in code.

---

### **Step 4: Real-World Benefits**

Thanks to the **ARM template**, Emma can now:

* **Automate** repetitive infrastructure tasks
* **Version control** templates using Git for auditability
* **Scale** deployments across teams and environments
* Ensure **consistency** and compliance with security policies

When a developer like **Liam** needs a test machine, Emma can redeploy the template in minutes without worrying about missing configuration details.

---

### **Step 5: Tearing Down the Resources**

After the environment is no longer needed, Emma simply navigates to the **Resource Group**, selects all associated resources, and deletes them. This helps avoid unnecessary costs and keeps the cloud environment tidy.

---

## **Conclusion**

Through this scenario, Emma effectively leverages **ARM templates** and **Azure CLI** in **Azure Cloud Shell** to deploy and manage infrastructure. Her workflow not only simplifies her job but also accelerates development and aligns with modern **DevOps** practices.

This lab isn't just an academic exercise‚Äîit's a real-world solution to the challenges of manual, error-prone infrastructure provisioning in a dynamic cloud environment.

### üîç Diagram Summary:

This diagram outlines how **Naveed**, the **Curious Cloud Explorer**, used an **ARM template** to deploy a **Windows Virtual Machine**. It breaks the process into 5 key stages: downloading the template, uploading it to **Cloud Shell**, deploying with **CLI**, verifying in the **Azure Portal**, and cleaning up resources. Each step uses core Azure services like **Resource Groups**, **Virtual Machines**, **Network Interfaces**, and **Storage Accounts** to deliver infrastructure-as-code in a structured and automated fashion.
