**Duration:** 30m
---

**After logging in with your credentials:**

### Step 1: Explore the ARM Template

1. Download the `template.json` file from the provided lab resources and extract it to your local machine.
2. Review the structure of the ARM template. It includes:

   * **Parameters** such as `adminUsername`, `adminPassword`, `dnsLabelPrefix`, and VM configuration options.
   * **Variables** for commonly reused values (e.g., subnet name, virtual network name).
   * **Resources** including a storage account, public IP, network security group (NSG), virtual network (VNet), network interface (NIC), and a virtual machine.
   * **Outputs** to return the public DNS hostname of the deployed VM.

### Step 2: Upload the Template to Cloud Shell

1. Open **Cloud Shell** from the top-right menu in the Azure Portal.
2. Select **Bash** when prompted.
3. If asked to configure storage, select **No storage account required**, and choose the appropriate subscription.
4. Use the **Upload** option in Cloud Shell to upload your `template.json` file into the shell environment.

### Step 3: Deploy the ARM Template

1. Use the following command in Cloud Shell to deploy the template:

   ```bash
   az deployment group create \
     --name <deployment-name> \
     --template-file template.json \
     --parameters '{
       "adminUsername": {"value": "<admin-username>"},
       "adminPassword": {"value": "<admin-password>"}
     }' \
     --resource-group <resource-group-name>
   ```

   Replace the placeholders:

   * `<deployment-name>`: A unique name for this deployment.
   * `<admin-username>`: Your chosen VM administrator username.
   * `<admin-password>`: A strong password (12+ characters) for the VM.
   * `<resource-group-name>`: The name of the target resource group.

2. Wait for the command to complete. This may take several minutes.

### Step 4: Verify Deployment in the Portal

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the **Resource groups** blade.
2. Open the resource group used in the deployment.
3. Confirm that resources were successfully created:

   * A Windows virtual machine.
   * Network components such as a NIC, VNet, and NSG.
   * A public IP address.
   * A storage account for diagnostics.

### Step 5: Delete All the Resources

Delete all the resources.

## **Structured Summary: Deploy a Windows VM Using an ARM Template**

### **Purpose of the Lab**

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how to deploy a **Windows Virtual Machine (VM)** using an **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template** through the **Azure Cloud Shell**. This approach emphasizes the use of **infrastructure as code (IaC)** to automate resource deployment, enhance repeatability, and reduce manual configuration errors in cloud environments. The lab helps learners understand how declarative JSON-based templates can define and deploy complex Azure infrastructures in a consistent and scalable manner.

## **Professional Scenario: Automating VM Deployment with ARM Templates**

**Background:**

Meet **Emma**, a Cloud Engineer working at **Contoso Financial Services**, a mid-sized company moving its infrastructure to the cloud. Her team is responsible for managing development and test environments in **Microsoft Azure**. The developers frequently request Windows-based **Virtual Machines (VMs)** with similar configurations. Emma needs a way to standardize and automate these requests without manually clicking through the **Azure portal** every time.

**The Challenge:**

Manual VM creation is time-consuming and error-prone. Each VM requires setting up networking, assigning a **Public IP address**, configuring **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**, and enabling **boot diagnostics**. Emma needs a repeatable, auditable, and scalable way to deploy infrastructure consistently. That's where **ARM templates** come into play.

---

## **Scenario Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Understanding the ARM Template**

Emma starts by reviewing an **ARM template** named `template.json`, which is a **JSON** file defining all the infrastructure components needed to deploy a Windows **Virtual Machine**. This includes:

* **Virtual Network (VNet)** and **Subnet** for network isolation
* **Network Interface (NIC)** for network connectivity
* A **Network Security Group (NSG)** to allow **RDP** access
* A **Storage Account** for diagnostics
* A **Public IP address** for remote access
* The **VM** itself with custom parameters like OS version, size, and admin credentials

By using this template, Emma ensures that every VM deployment is uniform and compliant with organizational standards.

---

### **Step 2: Deploying the Template via Azure Cloud Shell**

Emma logs into the **Azure portal** and launches **Azure Cloud Shell (Bash)**, which provides a browser-based CLI environment without any local setup. She uploads the `template.json` file using the **Manage file** option.

Using the **Azure CLI** inside Cloud Shell, Emma runs the deployment command:

```bash
az deployment group create \
  --name dev-vm-deployment \
  --template-file template.json \
  --parameters '{
    "adminUsername": {"value": "emmaadmin"},
    "adminPassword": {"value": "StrongPassword123!"}
  }' \
  --resource-group DevResources
```

This command triggers the **ARM template** deployment, which orchestrates the creation of all resources in the specified **Resource Group**.

---

### **Step 3: Verifying the Deployment**

Once the deployment finishes, Emma navigates to the **Resource Group** in the **Azure portal**. She sees:

* A fully provisioned **Windows VM**
* A connected **NIC** attached to a **VNet**
* An assigned **Public IP**
* An associated **NSG** with **RDP** port open
* A configured **Storage Account** for diagnostics

The best part? All of this was done with a single command using infrastructure defined in code.

---

### **Step 4: Real-World Benefits**

Thanks to the **ARM template**, Emma can now:

* **Automate** repetitive infrastructure tasks
* **Version control** templates using Git for auditability
* **Scale** deployments across teams and environments
* Ensure **consistency** and compliance with security policies

When a developer like **Liam** needs a test machine, Emma can redeploy the template in minutes without worrying about missing configuration details.

---

### **Step 5: Tearing Down the Resources**

After the environment is no longer needed, Emma simply navigates to the **Resource Group**, selects all associated resources, and deletes them. This helps avoid unnecessary costs and keeps the cloud environment tidy.

---

## **Conclusion**

Through this scenario, Emma effectively leverages **ARM templates** and **Azure CLI** in **Azure Cloud Shell** to deploy and manage infrastructure. Her workflow not only simplifies her job but also accelerates development and aligns with modern **DevOps** practices.

This lab isn't just an academic exerciseâ€”it's a real-world solution to the challenges of manual, error-prone infrastructure provisioning in a dynamic cloud environment.
