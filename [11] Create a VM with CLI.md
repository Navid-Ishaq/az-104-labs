  --name vm-ncloudedge-web01 \
  --resource-group rg-learntech-naveed \
  --image win2019datacenter \
  --size Standard_B1s \
  --admin-username $username \
  --admin-password $password
```

This single command didn‚Äôt just create a **virtual machine**. It also deployed related infrastructure: a **virtual network**, **subnet**, **public IP**, **network interface card (NIC)**, and **network security group (NSG)** ‚Äî all in one go. That‚Äôs the power of **CLI automation**: speed and precision.

---

### üîó Step 4: Connect and Verify

Minutes later, **Naveed** navigated to **Virtual Machines** in the Azure portal and selected **vm-ncloudedge-web01**.

### **Practical Scenario: Deploying a Secure Windows VM via CLI for Remote Team Access**

---

**Meet Sarah**, a Cloud Engineer working for a mid-sized software development firm. Her team is working on a legacy Windows application that needs to be tested in a controlled, cloud-based environment. The testing environment must be deployed quickly, securely, and without relying on graphical interfaces‚Äîbecause the operations team automates infrastructure using scripts.

Her manager assigns her the task:

> ‚ÄúSarah, we need a **Windows Virtual Machine** up and running in Azure by the end of the hour, using the **CLI** only. Ensure it‚Äôs accessible via **RDP**, and please make sure all resources are grouped logically for easy cleanup later.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs walk through Sarah‚Äôs journey step-by-step and see how she completes the task using **Azure CLI** in the **Azure Cloud Shell**.

---

#### **Step 1: Access Azure Cloud Shell**

Sarah opens the **Azure Portal** and clicks on the **Cloud Shell** icon at the top of the interface. She selects **Bash**, as her team standardizes on it for automation tasks.

Azure prompts her to create a temporary **Cloud Shell** storage (since none exists), and she clicks **Apply** using the default options.

---

#### **Step 2: Define Secure Credentials**

Sarah knows it's a security best practice not to hard-code usernames and passwords in the command directly. So, she stores them in variables:

```bash
username="demouser"
password="MyS3curePassw0rd123"
```

These values will be used in the next command without exposing them in logs.

---

#### **Step 3: Deploy the Virtual Machine**

Sarah now constructs her **Azure CLI** command to deploy the **Windows VM**. She gathers the name of the assigned **resource group** from the lab instructions and runs:

```bash
az vm create \
  --name MyVm \
  --resource-group TestGroup \
  --image win2019datacenter \
  --size Standard_B1s \
  --admin-username $username \
  --admin-password $password
```

This command tells Azure to:

* Create a VM named **MyVm**
* Use the **Windows Server 2019** image
* Use a **Standard\_B1s** size (suitable for light workloads)
* Automatically create related resources: **Virtual Network**, **Subnet**, **NIC**, **NSG**, and **Public IP Address**

Within a few minutes, Azure returns a success message along with the **public IP address** of the new VM.

---

#### **Step 4: Connect via RDP**

Sarah navigates to the **Virtual Machines** section in the **Azure Portal**, selects **MyVm**, and clicks **Connect**.

She downloads the **RDP file**, opens it on her Windows PC, and logs in using the username and password she defined earlier.

The VM boots up successfully, and the legacy test application is ready to be deployed.

---

#### **Step 5: Business Benefit**

Thanks to **Azure CLI** and **Cloud Shell**, Sarah:

* Deployed a Windows environment securely and quickly
* Avoided configuration drift by using CLI-based infrastructure setup
* Created all necessary **networking** and **security** components without touching the portal UI
* Made the environment disposable by grouping everything into one **resource group**

This approach aligns with her company‚Äôs **DevOps** and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles, supporting scalability, repeatability, and ease of cleanup.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Sarah demonstrates how using **Azure CLI** via **Cloud Shell** can enable fast, secure, and repeatable VM deployments, especially in environments where GUI access is discouraged or where automation is critical. This lab reflects a real-world need for IT professionals to rapidly deploy test environments, conduct patch testing, or support remote teams‚Äîwith minimal effort and maximum control.

### üìù Diagram Summary:

This **text-based diagram** illustrates the **end-to-end process** of deploying a **Windows Virtual Machine** using **Azure CLI** via **Cloud Shell**. It starts with accessing the **Bash environment**, defining **secure credentials**, executing the **VM deployment**, and then **verifying access** via **RDP**. The diagram ensures a beginner can visualize how different **Azure resources** (like **VNet**, **NSG**, **Public IP**) are automatically provisioned during the process.
