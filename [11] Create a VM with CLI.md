# Lab 11: Create a VM with CLI

**Duration:** 30m

_Description will be added soon._

After logging in with your credentials:

### Create a Virtual Machine Using Azure CLI

1. In the Azure Portal, open **Azure Cloud Shell** by selecting the shell icon in the top menu bar.

2. When prompted, choose **Bash**.

3. If required, choose **No storage account required**, select the available subscription, and click **Apply**.

4. Once Cloud Shell initializes, define the administrator credentials securely using variables:

   ```bash
   username="demouser"
   password="YourSecurePassword123"
   ```

5. Create a Windows Server 2019 virtual machine by running the following command. Replace `<resource-group>` with your actual resource group name:

   ```bash
   az vm create \
     --name MyVm \
     --resource-group <resource-group> \
     --image win2019datacenter \
     --size Standard_B1s \
     --admin-username $username \
     --admin-password $password
   ```

   > This command provisions a Windows VM and automatically deploys associated resources such as a virtual network, subnet, public IP, NIC, and network security group.

### Connect to the Virtual Machine via RDP

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to **Virtual Machines** from the left-hand menu.

2. Select the **MyVm** virtual machine from the list.

3. On the virtual machine's overview page, click **Connect**, then choose **RDP**.

4. Download the **RDP file**, open it, and log in using the previously defined `$username` and `$password`.

   > On Windows: Open the downloaded `.rdp` file and authenticate.
   > On Linux/Mac: Use an RDP client, enter the VMâ€™s public IP, and authenticate with your credentials.

5. Once connected, confirm that the Windows OS boots and is ready for use.

Delete all the resources.
