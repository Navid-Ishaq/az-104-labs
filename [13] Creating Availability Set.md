## **Lab Summary: Creating an Availability Set in Azure**

### **Purpose of the Lab**

The primary objective of this lab is to demonstrate how to improve the **availability** and **resiliency** of virtual machines in **Microsoft Azure** by deploying them within an **Availability Set**. This setup helps ensure high availability for applications by distributing VMs across multiple **fault domains** and **update domains**, thereby reducing the risk of simultaneous failure. The lab walks through the steps to create an **Availability Set**, deploy two **Virtual Machines (VMs)** into that set, and understand how this configuration supports business continuity and disaster recovery strategies.

### **Azure Tools Utilized in the Lab**

1. ### **Azure Portal**

   * **Description**: A web-based unified console for managing Azure resources.
   * **Role in Lab**: Used to create and manage all Azure resources, including the **Availability Set** and **Virtual Machines**.

2. ### **Availability Set**

   * **Description**: A logical grouping capability for isolating VM resources from each other when deployed.
   * **Role in Lab**: Provides **fault domain** and **update domain** isolation to ensure that VMs deployed together are distributed across different physical hardware and update cycles. This enhances the applicationâ€™s availability during planned or unplanned maintenance.

3. ### **Virtual Machine (VM)**

   * **Description**: An on-demand, scalable computing resource offered by Azure.
   * **Role in Lab**: Two VMs (Ubuntu-based) are deployed within the **Availability Set** to simulate a production-like environment and test redundancy capabilities.

4. ### **Resource Group**

   * **Description**: A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.
   * **Role in Lab**: Used to logically group all resources created in the lab (e.g., VMs and availability sets), allowing for easier management and deletion.

5. ### **Managed Disks**

   * **Description**: Azure-managed block-level storage volumes used with Azure VMs.
   * **Role in Lab**: Ensures that disk storage is handled automatically with high availability and alignment with the **Availability Set**.

6. ### **VM Image**

   * **Description**: A template used to create new VMs, including OS and software.
   * **Role in Lab**: Predefined Ubuntu Server images are used to create the two VMs, demonstrating cross-version deployments within the same **Availability Set**.

7. ### **Authentication Type (Password)**

   * **Description**: One of the secure methods to access the VM via SSH or RDP.
   * **Role in Lab**: Used to set up access credentials for each VM during deployment.

8. ### **Review + Create**

   * **Description**: A validation checkpoint before deploying resources.
   * **Role in Lab**: Ensures all configurations are correct before provisioning each VM and the availability set.

## **Real-World Scenario: Ensuring Application Uptime with Azure Availability Sets**

**Background**

Emily is a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer at a mid-sized e-commerce company called **NorthCraft Retail**. The companyâ€™s operations rely on a custom-built order processing application that must be available 24/7, especially during high-traffic seasons like Black Friday. Recently, Emily's team experienced downtime when both VMs hosting the app were rebooted during scheduled maintenance. This incident prompted leadership to mandate a redesign of the architecture for improved **availability**.

To address this, Emily decides to implement an **Azure Availability Set** to ensure that the virtual machines (VMs) hosting the application are distributed across different **fault domains** and **update domains**. This will significantly reduce the likelihood of simultaneous VM outages due to hardware failures or maintenance events.

---

## **Implementation Journey**

### **Step 1: Create an Availability Set**

Emily logs into the **Azure Portal**, navigates to **Create a resource**, and searches for **Availability Set**. She names the set **WhizAvail**, places it in the **rg\_eastus\_XXXXXX** **resource group**, and selects **Central US** as the region. By enabling **Managed Disks**, she ensures the infrastructure is aligned for maximum uptime and compatibility.

> âœ… **Benefit**: This ensures the application components are distributed across different physical servers, avoiding single points of failure.

---

### **Step 2: Deploy the First VM in the Availability Set**

Emily creates the first VM named **WhizlabAvail1** using the **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS** image. She assigns it to the **WhizAvail** **availability set**, ensuring it will be placed in a separate **fault domain** and **update domain** than other VMs in the same set. She chooses **B2s** as the VM **size**, sets **Whizlabavail1** as the **username**, and configures a secure **password**.

> âœ… **Benefit**: Even if one VM is rebooted during Azure maintenance or due to unexpected hardware failure, the other VM continues to serve traffic.

---

### **Step 3: Deploy the Second VM in the Same Availability Set**

After waiting a few minutes to let the platform distribute resources, Emily creates a second VM named **WhizlabAvail2**, this time using **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS**. She also places this VM into the same **WhizAvail** **availability set**, following a similar configuration approach with different **username** and **password** credentials.

> âœ… **Benefit**: By having two VMs in different **fault domains**, high availability is achieved without needing more expensive services like **Availability Zones** or **Azure Load Balancer** (though they can be added later).

---

### **Step 4: Application Deployment and Monitoring**

With both VMs in place, Emily can now install the application across both servers. She can use a script or CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment. She monitors both VMs using **Azure Monitor** to ensure they operate independently and maintain performance.

---

## **Outcome**

Thanks to her use of **Availability Sets**, Emily ensures that no single update or physical server issue can bring down the application completely. This aligns with her company's **business continuity** and **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** commitments, while also optimizing costs by using **standard VM SKUs**.

> ðŸ’¼ **Professional Insight**: For any mission-critical application not yet migrated to **Azure Availability Zones**, **Availability Sets** remain a cost-effective and reliable method for fault isolation.

## **Conclusion**

This lab reflects a realistic scenario faced by cloud engineers in maintaining system uptime. It teaches how to strategically distribute virtual machines using **Azure Availability Sets** to protect against outages, support scaling, and align infrastructure with **high availability** design principles.
