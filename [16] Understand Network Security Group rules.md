## **Professional Scenario: Implementing NSG Rules to Secure a Production VM**

### **Scenario Title: ‚ÄúDavid Secures a Web Server in Azure‚Äù**

**David**, a cloud engineer at a mid-sized IT services company, has just been assigned a task by his manager: deploy a **Windows Server virtual machine** in **Microsoft Azure**, configure it as a basic **web server**, and ensure that **only necessary ports are open** to reduce security risks. The project is for a client who needs a test environment to simulate real traffic to a public-facing application.

---

### **Step 1: Creating a Virtual Machine**

To begin, David signs into the **Azure Portal** using his organization‚Äôs credentials. He opens the **Virtual Machines** service and clicks **Create ‚Üí Azure virtual machine**.

He configures the VM with the following:

* **Resource Group**: `rg-west-test`
* **Virtual Machine Name**: `ProdVM-Web1`
* **Region**: `West Europe`
* **Image**: `Windows Server 2022 Datacenter - Gen2`
* **Size**: `Standard_B2s`
* **Username**: `adminuser`
* **Password**: `StrongPa$$word123`
* **Inbound Ports**: **None** (David plans to control access via **Network Security Group (NSG)**)

He selects **Standard SSD** for the OS disk, leaves networking and management settings as default, **disables boot diagnostics**, and finally reviews and clicks **Create**.

üõ†Ô∏è *At this point, David has provisioned a basic VM, but it‚Äôs not accessible from the outside yet because no network rules are applied.*

---

### **Step 2: Allowing RDP Access for Remote Management**

David now needs to access the VM remotely using **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**. He goes to the **Networking** tab of the newly created VM and sees an attached **NSG**.

He clicks on **‚ÄúAdd inbound port rule‚Äù** to allow RDP traffic.

* **Source**: `Service Tag`
* **Source Service Tag**: `Internet`
* **Destination**: `Any`
* **Service**: `RDP`
* **Action**: `Allow`
* **Priority**: `100`
* **Name**: `Allow-RDP-3389`

After saving the rule, he goes back to the **Overview** tab, clicks **Connect ‚Üí RDP**, and downloads the `.rdp` file. Using his credentials, David remotely logs into the server.

üéØ *He now has secure access to configure the machine as needed.*

---

### **Step 3: Installing IIS to Serve Web Content**

Inside the VM, David opens **Server Manager**, then uses the **Add Roles and Features** wizard to install **Web Server (IIS)**.

After installation, he launches **Microsoft Edge** on the VM and visits `http://localhost` to verify that the **IIS welcome page** is live.

---

### **Step 4: Creating an NSG Rule to Allow HTTP Traffic**

To make the IIS web server accessible to others, David needs to allow traffic on **port 80**. He returns to the **Azure Portal**, goes to the VM‚Äôs **Networking** section, and adds another inbound rule:

* **Source**: `Service Tag`
* **Source Service Tag**: `Internet`
* **Destination**: `Any`
* **Destination Port Ranges**: `80`
* **Protocol**: `TCP`
* **Action**: `Allow`
* **Priority**: `110`
* **Name**: `Allow-HTTP-80`

After applying the rule, David copies the **public IP address** of the VM and pastes it into his local browser:
`http://<public-ip>`

The **IIS welcome page** loads successfully, confirming that the **web server is publicly accessible** over **HTTP**, and access is securely controlled via **NSG rules**.

---

### **Why This Scenario Matters**

David‚Äôs actions reflect a **real-world use case**:

* He **only opens necessary ports** (**3389 for RDP**, **80 for HTTP**) ‚Äî reducing attack surface.
* He uses **Network Security Groups** to enforce **inbound traffic control**.
* He ensures the VM is **secure yet accessible**, adhering to best practices in cloud deployments.

This workflow is foundational for many business applications ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs hosting internal tools, staging web applications, or providing remote access to managed servers.

---

### **Summary of Key Azure Concepts Demonstrated**

* **Azure Virtual Machine**: Hosted workload that requires controlled access.
* **Network Security Group (NSG)**: Firewall-like rules applied at the network interface level.
* **Inbound Rules**: Explicitly allow or deny incoming traffic to the VM.
* **RDP (port 3389)**: Allows remote administration of Windows VMs.
* **HTTP (port 80)**: Used to serve web content from IIS.
* **Public IP Address**: Enables external users to reach the VM or service.

---

This scenario helps learners understand how to **securely expose services** in Azure while maintaining **network hygiene and control**‚Äîskills critical for cloud administrators and DevOps professionals.

## ‚úÖ How David Completed His Task ‚Äì Explained Simply

### üë®‚Äçüíº Who is David?

David is a cloud engineer. That means he helps his company use online tools (like Microsoft Azure) to run computers, websites, and services without needing physical machines.

---

### üéØ What Was David‚Äôs Goal?

David's boss asked him to:

* **Create a virtual computer** in the cloud.
* **Install a website on it** (called a web server).
* **Let people access it** safely from the internet.
* **Make sure only allowed traffic comes in** (to keep it secure).

---

## ü™ú Step-by-Step ‚Äì What David Did

### üñ•Ô∏è Step 1: Created a Virtual Computer (VM)

* David logged into Microsoft Azure (a website where you can create online computers).
* He clicked to **create a virtual machine** (this is just a computer in the cloud).
* He gave it a name and chose settings like the location (**West Europe**) and operating system (**Windows Server**).
* He also set up a **username and password** to log in later.

üß† *Think of this like buying a brand-new laptop, but it lives on the internet.*

---

### üîê Step 2: Allowed Remote Access (RDP)

* At first, the computer was created, but **no one could connect to it**.
* David opened something called **Network Security Group (NSG)** ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a list of rules that control who can talk to the computer.
* He **added a rule** to allow remote access (called **RDP**, which is used to connect to Windows machines).
* After this, David was able to **log into the computer remotely**, just like using TeamViewer or Zoom screen share.

üß† *Now David can "sit" at this virtual computer from anywhere.*

---

### üåê Step 3: Installed a Website Server (IIS)

* David used a tool inside the computer called **Server Manager**.
* He **installed IIS**, a program that lets the computer act like a website host.
* Then he tested it by visiting **[http://localhost](http://localhost)**, and it worked ‚Äî the computer was ready to show a webpage.

üß† *This step is like putting a sign on a shop window saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre open!‚Äù*

---

### üåé Step 4: Let the Public See the Website

* Even though the website was working inside the computer, **no one outside could see it yet**.
* David added another rule in the NSG to **allow traffic on port 80** (used for websites).
* He copied the **public IP address** of the computer and pasted it in his own browser.

üéâ He saw the website live from the internet!

üß† *This is like opening the shop doors to customers.*

---

## ‚úÖ Why David‚Äôs Work Was Efficient

* He did everything **step by step**, without missing anything.
* He **only opened the ports he needed** (just RDP and HTTP), which is safe.
* He **tested** each part ‚Äî the login, the website inside, and the public access.
* He kept it **clean, organized**, and **secure**.
